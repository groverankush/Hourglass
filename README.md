## Getting Started

These are the all the instructions you need to use SuperLog in your apps.

### Compile

Just a simple debug `compile` will get you up and running with SuperLog.

```
compile 'com.ankushgrover:SuperLog:1.0.10'
```


### Initialize

It's preferable to initialize SuperLog in your application's `onCreate()` method.

```
SuperLog.init(new SuperLog.Builder(getApplication())
        .setSuperLogViewVisibility(true) \\For globally changing SuperLogView's visibility
        .setCredentials("YOUR_GMAIL_ADDRESS", "YOUR_PASSWORD")); \\For sending email in background
```
For sending mails in the background, you need to specify email address and password of the account. As the library uses explicit SMTP server for sending mails in background, so for that account credentials are required.
IF YOU ARE USING THIS FEATURE, IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO USE A TEST ACCOUNT IN PLACE OF YOUR PRIMARY ACCOUNT. YOU ALSO NEED TO ALLOW ACCESS TO LESS SECURE APPS FOR YOUR GMAIL ACCOUNT. More about this [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en) and [here](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps).

### Add View

After initialization you can simply add `SuperLogView` in any of your layout files. On clicking this view, you will be presented with all the logs created by SuperLog in a color coded format along with some extra functionality.

```
    <com.ankushgrover.superlog.views.SuperLogView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_gravity="bottom"
        android:textStyle="bold" />
```

### Examples

You can use the SuperLog fuctions as specified here.

```
SuperLog.d("TAG", "message"); // debug log
SuperLog.v("TAG", "message"); // verbose log
SuperLog.w("TAG", "message"); // warning log
SuperLog.e("TAG", "message"); // error log
SuperLog.log("No tag required")

```
These statements will create logs in android monitor as well as save in persistent storage. Logs generated by these can be easily accessed by tapping SuperLogView.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
